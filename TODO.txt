1. Allow for the ability to create global product user or role based rules.  
   These would be used in the absense of any product specific rules.  Only 
   percentage based rules would be applicable though.

2. This module shares a lot of administrative interface code with the 
uc_bulk_discount module to make the interfaces consistent for the client.
Maybe abstract the administrative functionality into a general purpose module
that these two modules require?
