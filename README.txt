 Ubercart Member Pricing:  uc_member_pricing.module
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 DESCRIPTION
  
 Allows users with a "manage prices" role to specify per product price 
 adjustments base on either user or role based rules.
 
 This price adjustment can be a specic price, a amount offset, or a percentage 
 offset from the original price of the base product (not attribute products, 
 which may already add their own amounts to the result of this modules price 
 adjustment).
 
 It is important to consider the order of precedence when creating these rules.
 
 1. Role based pricing overrides the standard Ubercart "sell_price".  When a 
 		user is a member of multiple roles with a specified pricing rule, then the
 		lowest priced role price is used.
 		
 2. User based pricing overrides all role based rules. 
 
  
 See the TODO.txt for known remaining tasks.  If you have ideas, let us know.

*  INSTALLATION  *
******************

 Currently this module requires the following Drupal modules be installed
 and enabled.
 
   * Ubercart  -  http://drupal.org/project/ubercart

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 TO INSTALL VIA DRUPAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We highly recommend using drush if possible.  This will drastically speed up 
 downloading and updating your Drupal packages.
 
   See http://drupal.org/project/drush
   
   
 WITH DRUSH
 
   From your root Drupal site directory, run:
   
   
   COMMAND_PROMPT$ drush dl uc_member_pricing
   
   
   The to update, all you have to do is:
   
   
   COMMAND_PROMPT$ drush update
   
   
   This will update any contributed projects that have new releases.  This is
   much better than downloading the packages yourself.  Oh, drush is extensible
   as well, so you can write your own drush modules.
   
   
 WITHOUT DRUSH
 
   Go download the recommended package from the drupal project page.  Untar in
   your sites/all/modules folder or wherever you are putting your modules.

1. Go to the administration page, [ /admin/user/permissions ], and find the

   administer special user or role based pricing at your site.  Not that these
   users can change the price of any product on the site.
   
2. Create your products.

3. After you have created your products, you will see a new tab under the node
   edit page, called "Prices". Go there an start creating your rules.  Follow
   the instructions on the rule add or edit form.  These rules become active for
   the users and roles that they apply to on that page.
